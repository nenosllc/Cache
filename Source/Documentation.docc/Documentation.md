# ``Cache``

**Cache** helps provide straightforard data caching for Swift applications.

## Overview

Cache doesn't claim to be unique in this area, but it's not another monster library that gives you a god's power. It does nothing but caching, but it does it well. It offers a good public API with out-of-box implementations and great customization possibilities. `Cache` utilizes `Codable` in Swift 4 to perform serialization.
